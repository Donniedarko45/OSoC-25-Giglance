# System Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the Giglance application, detailing its current and future tech stack.

## Overview

Giglance is a full-stack application designed to connect freelancers with clients. It consists of a frontend built with Next.js and a backend powered by Node.js (Express.js) with a PostgreSQL database managed by Prisma.

## Components

### Frontend

- **Technology**: Next.js (React), Clerk (Authentication), Tanstack Query (Data Fetching), Tailwind CSS (Styling)
- **Purpose**: Provides the user interface for clients and freelancers to interact with the platform. Handles user authentication, job browsing, profile management, and communication.
- **Key Features**:
    - Responsive UI/UX
    - Client and Freelancer dashboards
    - Job posting and application forms
    - User authentication and authorization via Clerk

### Backend

- **Technology**: Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript, Prisma (ORM)
- **Purpose**: Serves as the API layer for the frontend. Manages business logic, data storage, and external integrations.
- **Key Features**:
    - RESTful API endpoints for user management, job management, and more.
    - Authentication and authorization middleware.
    - Data validation and error handling.

### Database

- **Technology**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **Setup**: Docker for local development and deployment
- **Purpose**: Stores all application data, including user profiles, job listings, applications, messages, etc.

## Key Flows and Integrations

### Authentication Flow

- **Technology**: Clerk
- **Description**: Handles user registration, login, and session management. Integrates seamlessly with the Next.js frontend and provides secure authentication tokens for backend API access.

### Payment Flow

- **Technology**: Razorpay (Payment Gateway), Escrow Simulation
- **Description**: Facilitates secure transactions between clients and freelancers. Includes an escrow system to hold funds until project completion and client approval.

### Real-time Communication

- **Technology**: Socket.IO
- **Future Consideration**: Redis/Kafka for scalable message brokering
- **Description**: Enables real-time chat functionality between clients and freelancers, and potentially real-time notifications for job updates or application statuses.

### AI Recommendations

- **Technology**: OpenAI API (for AI models), pgvector (for vector embeddings in PostgreSQL)
- **Description**: Implements intelligent recommendation systems for jobs to freelancers and vice-versa, based on skills, preferences, and past interactions.

## DevOps Workflow

- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
- **Containerization**: Docker for packaging applications and their dependencies.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (future consideration for scalable deployments).
- **Deployment Platforms**: Vercel (for Frontend), Render (for Backend and Database).

## Monitoring

- **Tools**: Prometheus (Metrics Collection), Grafana (Dashboarding and Visualization)
- **Description**: Provides insights into application performance, resource utilization, and error rates, enabling proactive issue resolution and performance optimization.

## Data Flow

1.  **User Interaction**: Users interact with the Frontend (Next.js application).
2.  **API Requests**: The Frontend makes API requests to the Backend (Node.js/Express.js).
3.  **Business Logic**: The Backend processes the requests, applies business logic, and interacts with the database.
4.  **Database Operations**: Prisma ORM is used by the Backend to perform CRUD operations on the PostgreSQL database.
5.  **Response**: The Backend sends a response back to the Frontend.
6.  **UI Update**: The Frontend updates the UI based on the received data.

## Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed using Docker, as indicated by the `docker-compose.yml` file. This allows for easy containerization and orchestration of the frontend, backend, and database services.

## Future Considerations

-   **Scalability**: Implement caching mechanisms and load balancing for high traffic.
-   **Security**: Enhance security measures with more robust authentication and authorization, input validation, and regular security audits.
-   **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Implement more sophisticated search and filtering capabilities for jobs and freelancers.
